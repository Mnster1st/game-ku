<h5>The International 2021 is the concluding tournament of the Dota Pro Circuit and the tenth annual edition of The International which returns to Europe for the first time since 2011. The invite format is similar to the format used for the preceding International, whereby a point system based on official sponsored Regional Leagues and Majors will be used to determine the teams invited to The International.<br><br>

The tournament was originally scheduled to be held from August 18th to 23rd, 2020 in Avicii Arena in Stockholm, Sweden. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Valve delayed the event to 2021 tentatively. Valve later announced that the event will take place on August 5th to 15th, 2021. However, due to issue with hosting the tournament in Sweden, Valve announced the tournament will take place from October 7th to 17th in Arena Națională in Bucharest, Romania.</h5>
